# Notepads App [Preview]

******* This is a preview release of Notepads for testing purposes only. *******

Notes: Please do not share it with others. Design and features are not final, same for the App icon.

## Things that suppose to work in this preview version:

* Launch from command line or PowerShell: "notepads", "notepads <file>.txt" or with absolute path: "notepads foo\bar\<file>.txt"
* Select either single or multiple text files and right click to launch with Notepads is supported.
* All basic functions including new tab, save, save as and open file should work without problem.
* Right click context menu is also there and it changes based on mode (Insertion or Selection).
* Line Ending is based on existing context of your open file. CRLF will be used as default for New Document.txt.
* Encoding is based on existing context of your open file. UTF-8 will be used as default for New Document.txt.
* Save reminder on tab closing or app exiting when there is unsaved content.
* Ctrl+Tab / Ctrl+Shift+Tab to switch tab back and forward. Ctrl+N to create new tab and Ctrl+W to close active tab.

## Things are not working or not implemented in this preview version:

* Print, Search and Replace.
* Settings and any customization related.
* You won't be able to save files to system folders due to UWP restriction (I am waiting for the upcoming .Net Core / Win Apps / Xaml Island meta).

## Known issues:

* All tooltips hover are shown as CTRL+N.
* If you drag a file into Notepads, file picker will be shown when saving due to UWP restriction.
* Editor view resizing glitch is caused by system control and won't fix for now.
* Save as window does not show files, only folders.

## Author Notes:

The preview is intended to collect feedback, report bugs and glitches. As well as helping me come up with a list of items that you want me to put into settings (like what part of the UI you want to customize etc.)\n" +
Let me know if you have any. For more info and issue reporting, please use Github issues.
